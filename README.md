# Reinforcement-Learning

## Projects using Reinforcement algorithms

1. Pong Atari game in which RL is used to learn the model how to play the game. OpenAI is used to create the game's environment along with
   Tensorflow, Keras and Numpy to create neural networks. All is kept in Jupyter notebook.
2. Text based game using RL algorithms
